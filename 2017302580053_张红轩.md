## 1.P4

(a)  The request URL is <u>gaia.cs.umass.edu/cs453/index.html</u>

(b)  HTTP/1.1

(c)   It is  a persistent connection because "Connection:keep-alive"

(d)  There is no way to find the IP address in HTTP message alone

(e) Mozilla/5.0, because the server may return the different version of the same object according to the different type of User-agent

## 2.P9

Suppose average response time as *T<sub>AR</sub>*,  average access time as *T<sub>AA</sub>* , average Internet delay as *T<sub>aId</sub>*

(a)

From the question we can know the   *T<sub>aId</sub>* = 3 s

Δ = (850 000 b /15Mbps) = 0.057 
Δ β=16 * Δ=0.907
 *T<sub>AA</sub>* = Δ/(1-Δβ) = 0.057/(1-0.907) = 0.61s
so *T<sub>AR</sub>* = 3s+0.61s=3.61s. 

So the average response time is 3.61s.
(b)

We know the missing rate is 0.4,

so the hit rate = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6, which means 60% of requests can be responsed within the agency network.
*T<sub>AA</sub>* = Δ/(1-0.4\* Δβ)= 0.089s
If the cache is hit, the response time can be ignored. so:
*T<sub>AR</sub>* = (0.089s+3s)*0.4=1.24s. 

So the average response time is 1.24s.
