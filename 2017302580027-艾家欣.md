### Task 3. Problems in the second chapter

> #### Problem 5
>
>  I marked the answer in the following figure.
>
> ![P5.png](https://github.com/JULYAI/assignmentsGrade3/blob/master/images/P6.png)
>
> > a. Was the server able to successfully find the document or not? What time was the document reply provided?
>
> ***Answer:*** Yes, the server was able to successfully find the document at 12:39:45GMT, on Tuesday, 07 March, 2008.
>
> > b. When was the document last modified?
>
> ***Answer:*** On Saturday, 10 Dec, 2005. At 18:27:46GMT.
>
> > c. How many bytes are there in the document being returned?
>
> ***Answer:*** There are 3874 bytes being returned.
>
> > d. What are the first 5 bytes of the document being returned? Did the server agree to a persistent connection?
>
> ***Answer:*** The first 5 bytes are: "**<!doc**". The server agreed to a persistent connection because of "Keep-alive".

> #### Problem 9
>
> > a. Find the total average response time.
>
> ***Answer:*** The average internet delay: T<sub>aid</sub>Â = 3s
>
> $\Delta$ = 850,000 bits / 150 Mbps = 0.0567
>
> The average access time: T<sub>aa</sub> = $\Delta/(1-\Delta\beta)$ = 0.0567/(1-0.0567*16) = 0.607s
>
> Thus the average response time: T<sub>ar</sub> = T<sub>aid</sub> + T<sub>aa</sub> =3.607s
>
> > b. Now supppose a cache is installed in the institutional LAN. Suppose the miss rate is 0.4. Find the total response time.
>
> ***Answer:*** The hit rate: R<sub>hit</sub>=1-R<sub>miss</sub>=1-0.4=0.6
>
> The average access time: 
>
> T<sub>aa</sub> = $\Delta/(1-0.4\Delta\beta)$ = 0.567/(1-0.4\*0.567\*16) = 0.089s
>
> When the cache is hit, the response time can be ignored.
>
> Thus the average response time: 
>
> T<sub>ar</sub> = (T<sub>aa</sub>+T<sub>aid</sub>)*R<sub>miss</sub> = (0.089+3)\*0.4 = 1.236s.
