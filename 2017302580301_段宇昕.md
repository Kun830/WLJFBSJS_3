## telnet maths.whu.edu.cn 80
1. test the connection
   - enter the command mode (Ctrl+] escape)
   - use 'st' to test
   - return to the session  
   ![telnet maths.whu.edu.cn 80](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DYnamoX513/markdown-photots/master/computer%20network/Ch2/telnet/http1.png)  
2. send http request
   > GET /rcpy/bksjy2.htm HTTP/1.1  
   > Host: maths.whu.edu.cn  
3. response

## P4
* (a) The URL of the document is http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/cs453/index.html  
* (b) HTTP version 1.1  
* (c) The browser request a persistent connection, as the last line shows 'Connection:keep-alive'  
* (d) We can't get the IP address from HTTP datagram  
* (e) The browser's type is Mozilla/5.0. Since the server need to decide which version of the object should be sent to the browser according to its type.  
## P9 （中文版教材，命中率=0.4）
## 第九题在中文版和英文版教材上有出入，中文版上为 命中率=0.4，英文版上为 未命中率=0.4
* (a) Δ=850000bit / 15M bit/sec = 0.0567 sec  
    Total AVG response = Δ/(1-βΔ)+ 3 sec = 0.0567/(1-16*0.0567)+3 = 3.611 sec  
* (b) Δ= 0.0567 sec  
    β = 16*0.6 = 9.6 request/sec  
    when the cache is hit, response time = ~ msec ≈ 0  
    Total AVG response = 0.6*(Δ/(1-βΔ)+ 3 sec)   
        = 0.6*(0.0567/(1-9.6*0.0567)+3) = 1.875 sec
