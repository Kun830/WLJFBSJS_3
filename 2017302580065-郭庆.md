### 3 two questions of exercises

**p3**

**Application layer protocols**: DNS HTTP

**Transport layer protocols**: UDP for DNS; TCP for HTTP

**p4**

a. The file's url is gaia.cs.umass.edu/cs453/index.htm;

b. HTTP/1.1

c. It is a persistent connection. Cuzz the instructions contain a "Keep-alive"

d. I can't find the IP address cuzz this GET message doesn't contain a IP address for client. We need the TCP segment to answer this question.

e. The browser type is Mozilla/5.0 mentioned by User-Agent. The reason why the browser type is needed is the server need to send different type of the same object to different browsers.
