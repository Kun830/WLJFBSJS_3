## nslookup

```
C:\Users\Administrator>nslookup www.whu.edu.cn
服务器:  UnKnown
Address:  2620:0:ccc::2

*** UnKnown 找不到 www.whu.edu.cn: No response from server
```

## P1

### a

False. For each objects, the client will send an request message, so 4 request and 4 response in total. 

### b

True. Multiple web pages residing on the same server can be sent from the server to the same client over a single persistent TCP connection.

### c

False. Nonpersistent connections only support one HTTP request at one time.

### d

False. The date header in the HTTP response message indicates the time that HTTP server create the response and sent to the user.

### e

False. HTTP response may get empty message body when there is an error.

## P5

### a

Yes.  It shows http 200.`Date: Tue, 07 Mar 2008 12:39:45GMT` indicates the time.

### b

`Last-Modified: Sat, 10 Dec2005 18:27:46 GMT`

### c

`Content-Length: 3874`

### d

`<!doc`,which is the header of HTML. The response shows 'Connection:Keep-Alive', so this is a persistent connection.

## P7

The answer would be
`Σ(RTTi)  for i ∈ [0,N] + RTT0` ,which consist of the cost for DNS to lookup address together with connection establish time between Http server and browser, then another RTT0 for HTTP request and HTTP response.

## P10

The non-persistent HTTP make sense in this case. A single connnection sends 100Kbits data and 200 control bits, leaving the cost of control less than 0.2%. If we want to optimize the cost by replace it to persistent HTTP, it would only reduce nearly 0.2% time for transferring, so we do not expect significants gans over the non-persistent case.

## P11

### a

Yes.Each connection get 1/N of the link bandwidth over N connections.Bob has more connections then the other users, so it helps him get Web pages more quickly.

### b

Yes. It still speeds up Bob`s acquiring from the server compared to one parallel instance.
